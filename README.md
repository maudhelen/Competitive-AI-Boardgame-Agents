## Concepts tried
1. Utility agent focused on defense. Trying to keep high value card to itself and throwing away only low value.
2. Utility agent focused on attack. Trying to put on the table high value cards to maximize our point gain
3. Combination of the above two. First starting strong, and then focusing on defense.
4. MiniMax. We had some doubts about it in the beginning, because obviously the minimax that we studied in class was aimed at players interchanging turns. However, in the end we decided to give it a try and remake it to suit this game.
side note: In the end we decided to only go with the defense option, because MiniMax lost a quite a few times agains it.
