    "## Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for Checkers\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation includes an advanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for the game of Checkers. It encompasses several key components: MCTS with UCB1 for node selection, dominance-based early stopping, tile count heuristic for game evaluation, and the Old Faithful opening move strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of the Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MCTSNode Class**: Represents a node in the MCTS tree. Each node contains the game state, parent node, possible moves from the current state, and statistics for the number of wins and visits, crucial for the MCTS algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **UCB1 for Node Selection**: Implements the Upper Confidence Bound 1 (UCB1) algorithm for selecting a child node during the Selection phase of MCTS. UCB1 balances exploration of less visited nodes and exploitation of nodes known to be promising.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Old Faithful Opening Move**: A predefined optimal move for the initial state of the game. If the game is in its initial configuration, the algorithm will choose this move, speeding up the decision process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dominance-Based Early Stopping**: During the Simulation phase, if a move significantly improves the player's position (defined as a 2-piece advantage change), the simulation terminates early. This approach focuses on quickly capitalizing on advantageous situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Tile Count Heuristic**: A heuristic evaluation based on the difference in the number of pieces between players. It's used to estimate the game state's favorability for the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Monte Carlo Tree Search Solver (mcts_solver)**: The main function that orchestrates the MCTS process. It performs iterations of the MCTS algorithm, each consisting of four phases: Selection, Expansion, Simulation, and Backpropagation. The function returns the move associated with the most visited node after all iterations, indicating the best-found move.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- `mcts_solver`: The primary function to execute the MCTS algorithm, handling the logic for each phase of MCTS.\n",
    "- `simulate_game`: Simulates a game from the current state to its conclusion, using random moves, dominance checking, and the heuristic evaluation.\n",
    "- `is_dominant_position`: Checks if the current player's position is dominant enough to warrant early termination of the simulation.\n",
    "- `piece_count_heuristic`: Provides a heuristic score based on the difference in the number of pieces between the two players.\n",
    "- `old_faithful_move`: Determines if the Old Faithful move is applicable for the current game state.\n",
    "- `is_initial_board_state`: Checks if the game is in its initial board configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive MCTS implementation is designed to effectively balance between exploring new strategies and exploiting known advantageous paths, making it well-suited for complex strategic games like Checkers.\n"
